# Fighting Against Fake News (ARIES-IITDâ€™s hackathon)
## Overview
The Hackathon was focused on AI for Social
Good, specifically tailored to address the urgent challenge of combating fake news.

In an era where misinformation spreads faster than ever, the need for innovative and
effective solutions is paramount. Our mission is to harness the power of Artificial Intelligence
to create tools that can differentiate between fact and fiction, contributing positively to the
discourse on social media and beyond.

Countering fake news is an essential social service for several reasons:
<ul>
<li>Promotes Informed Decision-Making: Individuals and Organizations help ensure
that the public has access to accurate and reliable information, enabling them to make
informed decisions.</li>

<li>Protects Public Health: Ensures that people receive accurate guidance on preventive
measures, treatments, and vaccine information.</li>

<li>Safeguards Democracy: The dissemination of false information can undermine the
democratic process by influencing elections and public opinion through misinformation.
Hence, it becomes essential to combat fake news.</li>
